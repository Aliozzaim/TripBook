# TravelExplorer


This project is a full-stack application that allows users to create, view, update, and delete places. It consists of a backend API built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, and a frontend user interface built with React.js.

## Backend

The backend of the application is built using Node.js and Express.js. It utilizes MongoDB as the database for storing places and user data. The backend provides RESTful API endpoints for handling various operations related to places and user authentication. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are used for secure access to protected routes.

### Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- bcrypt.js
- Express Validator
- Mongoose

## Frontend

The frontend of the application is built using React.js. It offers an intuitive and interactive user interface for managing places. Users can sign up or log in to the application, create new places with descriptions and images, view existing places, update place details, and delete places if they are the creators. The frontend communicates with the backend API to fetch and manipulate data

### Technologies Used

- React.js
- React Router
- Axios

## How to Run the Application

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies for both the backend and frontend using `npm install` command in their respective directories.
3. Set up the environment variables required for the backend, such as the MongoDB connection string and JWT secret key
4. Run the backend server using `npm start` command.
5. Run the frontend development server using `npm start` command.
